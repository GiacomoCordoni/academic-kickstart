GALFOR is a project of Galactic archaeology (ERC-2016-STG, 716082) to address such hot topics of modern astrophysics. We will exploit the unique dataset that the Hubble Space Telescope and the major ground-based facilities have collected for us to investigate a huge number of Galactic and extra-Galactic star clusters and their stellar populations. GALFOR will study the star clusters that we observe today to shed light on the series of events that occurred at high redshift and led to the formation of the globular clusters and of their multiple populations.
