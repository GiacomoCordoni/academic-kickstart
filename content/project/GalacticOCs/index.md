The color–magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of Galactic open clusters are widely considered to be the prototypes of single stellar populations. By using photometry in ultraviolet and optical bands we discovered that the nearby
young cluster NGC 6705 (M11) exhibits an extended main-sequence turnoff (eMSTO) and a broadened main sequence (MS). This is the first evidence of multiple stellar populations in a Galactic open cluster. By using high-
resolution Very Large Telescope (VLT) spectra we provide direct evidence that the multiple sequences along the CMD correspond to stellar populations with different rotation rates. Specifically, the blue MS (bMS) is formed of
slow-rotating stars, while red-MS (rMS) stars are fast rotators. Moreover, we exploit photometry from Gaia data release 2 (DR2) to show that three Galactic open clusters, namely NGC 2099, NGC 2360, and NGC 2818, exhibit
the eMSTO, thus suggesting that it is a common feature among these objects. Previous work on the Large Magellanic Cloud star cluster NGC 1818 shows that slowly and rapidly rotating stars populate the bMS and rMS
observed in its CMD. The similarities between M11 and the young clusters of the Magellanic Clouds (MCs) suggest that rotation is responsible for the appearance of multiple populations in the CMDs of both Milky Way
open clusters and MCs young clusters.
The photometric analysis of 12 Galactic open clusters in Cordoni et al. 2018 shows that the same multiple-population phenomenon observed in Magellanic Clouds (MCs) is present in nearby open clusters. Nearly all the clusters
younger than ∼2.5 Gyr of both MCs exhibit extended main-sequence turnoffs (eMSTOs) and all the cluster younger than ∼700 Myr show broadened/split main sequences (MSs). High-resolution spectroscopy has revealed
that these clusters host stars with a large spread in the observed projected rotations. In addition to rotation, internal age variation is indicated as possibly responsible for the eMSTOs, making these systems the possible young
counterparts of globular clusters with multiple populations. Recent work has shown that the eMSTO+broadened MSs are not a peculiarity of MCs clusters. Similar photometric features have been discovered in a few Galactic
open clusters, challenging the idea that the color–magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of these systems are similar to single isochrones and opening new windows to explore the eMSTO phenomenon. We exploit photometry+proper
motions from Gaia DR2 to investigate the CMDs of open clusters younger than ∼1.5Gyr. Our analysis suggests that: (i) 12 open clusters show eMSTOs and/or broadened MSs, which cannot be due to either field contamination
or binaries; (ii) split/broadened MSs are observed in clusters younger than ∼700 Myr, while older objects display only an eMSTO, similarly to MCs clusters; (iii) the eMSTO, if interpreted as a pure age spread, increases with age, following the relation observed in MCs clusters and demonstrating that rotation is responsible for this
phenomenon.
