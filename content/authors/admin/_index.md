Hi there, 
I'm a Ph.D. student in Astronomy at the University of Padova and I am an active member of the [GALFOR](http://progetti.dfa.unipd.it/GALFOR/) research group. I got boht my Physics Bachelor degree and my Astronomy Master degree at the university of Padova, where I'm currently doing my Ph.D.

My research focuses on the study of Star cluster in the Milky Way and in the Magellanic Clouds, and I investigate different aspects of these puzzling and fascinating objects.
These are the main topics that I touched so far:

* Analysis of the internal dynamics of Multiple Stellar Populations in old Galactic Globular clusters coupling ground- and space-based photometry with Gaia DR2 proper motions.
* Study of extended Main-Sequence Turn-Offs  and split Main-Sequences in Young Galactic Open clusters with Gaia DR2 photometry
* Multiple Stellar Populations in Young Magellanic Clouds clusters. In this context I am P.I. of an approved _HST_ [proposal](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019hst..prop15945C/abstract) to unveil the nature of such phenomena.

Furthermore, I spent three months at the [Research School of Astronomy and Astrophysics](https://rsaa.anu.edu.au/) (ANU, Canberra, Australia) during which time I studied the dynamics of Very Metal-Poor stars in the Milky Way. Such rare stars provide a unique window into the formation of the Milky Way.
