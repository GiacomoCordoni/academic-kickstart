summary: Multiple stellar populations in Magellanic Cloud clusters - disentangling between age spread and rotation
abstract: "The discovery of multiple stellar populations in young and intermediate-age clusters has been one of the major findings in the field of stellar populations of the last decade. Their origin is one of the most-intriguing open issues of stellar astrophysics and provides new constraints on the assembly of galaxies and on star formation and evolution."
